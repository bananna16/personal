                    So far I have completed courses 1 and 2. This is a specialization offered by UCSD that delves into computational

                    So far, I have implemented algorithms to find recurring biological motifs in DNA, to linearly and cylicly sequence DNA
                    from their spectra, and to create deBrujin graphs in order to recreate DNA from smaller pieces. <br>
